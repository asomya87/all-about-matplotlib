Hello all!

I had prepared this class material to teach data visualization to students using the MATPLOTLIB library in Python.

The class material consists of:
1. Class PPT
2. Codes executed on Jupyter notebook
3. MATPLOTLIB cheat sheet.

I really enjoyed learning and preparing this material. 

I hope it helps you to learn data visualization
